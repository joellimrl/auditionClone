# Audition Clone - Web Rhythm Game

A web-based rhythm game inspired by Audition SEA, featuring arrow sequence matching with time pressure mechanics.

## Features

- **Line-based gameplay**: Complete arrow sequences within time limits
- **Time pressure mechanics**: Each line has a dynamic time limit (5-15 seconds)
- **Mistake tracking**: Game tracks errors but allows continuation
- **Score-based progression**: Earn points for correct inputs and line completions
- **Visual feedback**: Real-time input feedback with animations
- **Audio system**: Dynamic sound effects using Web Audio API
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Game statistics**: Track lines completed, mistakes, and average completion time

## How to Play

1. **Start the game**: Click the "Start Game" button
2. **Follow the sequence**: Arrow symbols will appear showing the sequence to press
3. **Time pressure**: You have a limited time to complete each line (5-15 seconds)
4. **Scoring**: 
   - **Correct Input**: 10 points per correct arrow key press
   - **Line Complete**: 50 bonus points for completing a full line
   - **Mistakes**: Tracked but don't end the game - press the correct key to continue
5. **Game duration**: 60 seconds total - complete as many lines as possible
6. **Statistics**: Game tracks your progress including mistakes and average line completion time

## Controls

- Memory management for long-running game sessions

## Scoring System

- **Base Points**: 10 points per correct arrow input
- **Line Completion Bonus**: 50 points for completing a full sequence
- **Mistake Tracking**: Mistakes are counted but don't prevent continuation
- **Game Statistics**: Final score, total mistakes, lines completed, and average line time
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Sequence length varies from 4-8 arrows per line
- **Time Pressure**: Each line has 5-15 seconds based on sequence length and difficulty

## Game Mechanics

### Sequence Generation
- **Dynamic Length**: Sequences range from 4-8 arrows based on difficulty
- **Pattern Types**: Simple, advanced patterns including mirror sequences
- **Repetition Avoidance**: System prevents immediate arrow repetition
- **Advanced Techniques**: Pattern-based, rhythm-based, complexity-based, and mirror generation

### Timing System
- **Line Timer**: Each sequence has 5-15 seconds based on length and difficulty
- **Game Timer**: 60-second total game duration
- **Visual Warnings**: Timer changes color when time is low (â‰¤10 seconds for game, â‰¤3 seconds for line)
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Time varies with sequence complexity and random factors

### Input Processing
- **Mistake Handling**: Incorrect inputs are tracked but don't stop progression
- **Rapid Input Detection**: System detects very fast input sequences (<50ms)
- **Input Buffering**: Maintains input history for analysis
- **Multi-modal Support**: Keyboard, mouse, and touch input

### Visual Feedback
- **Arrow States**: Active, completed, correct, incorrect visual states
- **Feedback Messages**: âœ“ (correct), âœ— (incorrect), LINE COMPLETE!, TIME OUT!
- **Color Coding**: Green for correct, red for incorrect, blue for complete, orange for timeout
- **Animation System**: Particle effects, score animations, and visual transitions
